# python txt loader
you need Python tkinter and tkinterdnd2 so just pip install those.

make a text file named anything
structure it with 3 lines
line 1: c: [r,g,b]
line 2: text: "text"
line 3: p: padding value

open the file, and drag the txt into the gray box
if it doesnt work check the formatting
